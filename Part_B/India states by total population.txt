title: India states by total population

Explain: 	This chart analyze India states by total population.
	Each square size indicate the amount of population in state.
	I calculate the amount of population by sum all states cities in dataset.

	We can see that Maharashtra has the largest population with 38 millions of people, and Mizoram has the lowest population.
	There is a very difference in state size in the big cities populations.
